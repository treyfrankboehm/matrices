# matrices

## Some basic matrix operators in C. Currently the program can perform 1,000,000 inversions of random 3x3 matrices in 4.22 seconds.

### What is done:
- Addition
- Multiplication
- Scalar multiplication
- Transposition
- Trace
- Submatrix
- Determinants
- Identity matrices
- Inverse

### What needs to be done:
- BETTER MEMORY MAGEMENT. Things need to be freed much more often that I have. I need to look into this before progressing.
- Eigenvalues/eigenvectors
