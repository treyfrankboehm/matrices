# matrices

## Some basic matrix operators in C. Currently the program can perform 1,000,000 inversions of random 3x3 matrices in 3.52 seconds.

### What is done:
- Addition
- Multiplication
- Scalar multiplication
- Transposition
- Trace
- Submatrix
- Determinants
- Identity matrices
- Inverse

### What needs to be done:
- Implement a square root algorithm for complex numbers
- Test the vectorNorm function (possible write a matrixNorm function?)
- Implement and test [power iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration) to get an eigenvalue/vector.
- Consider hard-coding eigenvalue algorithms for 3x3 and 4x4 systems.
- Find a way to get more eigenvalues/vectors in general.
- Miscellaneous functions (things like inner product)
- Long-term goal: Given a matrix A, solve the linear system described by x' = Ax
